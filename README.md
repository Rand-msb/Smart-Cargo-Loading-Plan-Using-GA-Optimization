# Smart-Cargo-Loading-Plan-Using-GA-Optimization
## Description
Genetic algorithm is a heuristic search method used in artificial intelligence and 
computing. It is used for finding optimized solutions to search problems based on 
the theory of natural selection and evolutionary biology such as selection, mutation, 
inheritance, and recombination to solve a problem. The most commonly employed 
method in genetic algorithms is to create a group of individuals randomly from a
given population

Using python programming language we will build a genetic algorithm solution for 
a client of a cargo company that wants to optimize its container-loading plan. The 
loading plan involves loading the shipment items, each of which weighs a different 
amount, into the available containers with an optimal loading plan where the 
difference between items weights in each container is minimized.
